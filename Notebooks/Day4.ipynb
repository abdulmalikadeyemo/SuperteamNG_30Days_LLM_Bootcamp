    "Our chatbot can now use tools to answer user questions, but it doesn't remember the context of previous interactions. \n",

    "This limits its ability to have coherent, multi-turn conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph solves this problem through persistent checkpointing. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you provide a `checkpointer` when compiling the graph and a `thread_id` when calling your graph, LangGraph automatically saves the state after each step. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you invoke the graph again using the same `thread_id`, the graph loads its saved state, allowing the chatbot to pick up where it left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see later that checkpointing is much more powerful than simple chat memory - it lets you save and resume complex state at any time for error recovery, human-in-the-loop workflows, time travel interactions, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "But lets not get too ahead of ourselves, let's add checkpointing to enable multi-turn conversations."
